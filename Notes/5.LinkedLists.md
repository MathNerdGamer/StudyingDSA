# Linked Lists

## Singly-Linked List

* A singly-linked list is a data structure which, conceptually, comprises of a `Node` called `head` which is the beginning of the structure, where a `Node` points holds both the `data` it stores and a reference to the `next` node in the list, and the methods necessary to access, insert, and remove the `Node`s.

* We can use this to implement the List ADT, like we did with `ArrayList`. Unlike an `ArrayList`, we don't store things in a contiguous block of memory, which introduces some complications. However, other complications given by `ArrayList` are alleviated.

* Recall that an `ArrayList` supports random access, meaning that access times come down to simply computing an offset from the base pointer to the array. A `SinglyLinkedList` does not have this, because the only way to access a particular node is to start from the beginning of the list and hop to each `next` reference.

* On the other hand, inserting or removing an element in a `SinglyLinkedList` is quick at the front. This is because we need only allocate space for a new `Node`, put the data in, and make it the new head, an $O\left(1\right)$ operation. If we take the time to support a `Node` at the end (usually called `tail`), we also get quick insertions (though not deletions) at the end. Note that, while insertion had $O\left(1\right)$ *amortized* running time in an `ArrayList`, there still was that slow $O\left(n\right)$ operation that had to happen once in awhile when inserting a bunch.

* Doing any operation that requires accessing at index `0 < k < n` takes $\Omega\left(k\right)$ steps, since we have to do $k$ hops from `head`. Deletions at the end still require $\Omega\left(n\right)$ time, because we can't use the `tail` to edit the `next` pointer of the `Node` pointing to `tail`, though adding elements with a `tail` reference is $O\left(1\right)$ because we can go directly to the end to add a new `Node`.

* We can implement the `Iterable` interface with a `SinglyLinkedList`, which allows for looping with iterators.

* Suppose we implement a `SinglyLinkedList` to hold `Comparable` data in such a way that we guarantee sorted elements. Then, we can use recursion to remove duplicates.

```java
public void removeDuplicates() {
    head = recursivelyRemove(head);
}

private Node<T> recursivelyRemove(Node<T> node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return null;
    }

    node.next = recursivelyRemove(node.next);

    if (node.next != null && node.data.equals(node.next.data)) {
        return node.next;
    }

    return node;
}
```

* There are also other variants of linked lists.

## Doubly-Linked Lists
* A `DoublyLinkedList` is like a `SinglyLinkedList`, except each `Node` points to both the `next` *and* `prev` (previous) `Node`s.

* When we include a `tail` node reference, which we typically do for doubly-linked lists, this solves the inefficiency of removing from the end of a list that the `tail` node couldn't solve on its own in a `SinglyLinkedList`. This is because we can go to the tail, use its `prev` reference to edit what the `Node` before `tail` points to, and then make it the new `tail` node.

* This also, technically, gives opertions on any index `0 < k < n` takes $\Omega\left(\min\left\lbrace k, n-k \right\rbrace\right)$ steps, because we could always choose to go from the `tail` when it's closer than the `head`.

* There is a slightly higher overhead in both runtime and memory for individual `Node` operations, because we need to store and edit both `next` and `prev` references when changing things around.

## Circularly-Linked Lists

* A `CircularlyLinkedList` could be like either a `SinglyLinkedList` or a `DoublyLinkedList`, but where the final `Node` points back to `head` (and, if doubly-linked, `head` points to the final node). This alleviates the need for a `tail` pointer, since we can just move to `head.prev`.

* Termination conditions for loops do need to be changed. Instead of testing for `node == null`, we check `node == head` after handling the `head` case separately. Or, we could just store and use `size` to determine when to stop.

## Asymptotics for Various Implementations of the List ADT

Note: We include a `tail` in our linked lists.
