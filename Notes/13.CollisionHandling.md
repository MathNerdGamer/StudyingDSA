# Collision Handling

* There are two main categories of collision handling:
1. **Closed Addressing** - In closed addressing, all collisions are stored at the same place by some means.
2. **Open Addressing** - In open addressing, collisions result in data being stored in different locations based on the initial location where the collision occured.

## External Chaining

* *External chaining* is a closed addressing policy where each position in the backing array is a reference to a linked list where values whose keys collide are stored.

* In the example where we take phone numbers as keys and compress them into indices for the backing array by taking them modulo the capacity of the array, any phone numbers which ended up going to the same index would simply be appended to the linked list whose reference resides at the index.

* When using linked lists, we don't run out of space. However, if too many items end up stored at the same index, this will impact runtimes.
    * This means the worst case runtimes for `put()`/`get()`/`remove()` operations are $O\left(n\right)$, since everything *could* go to the same index.
    * As a result, we should consider a probabilistic approach to hash maps, including an average case analysis.
    * In the courses linked to in the [previous note](./12.HashMaps.md), more theory is developed which shows when hash maps will have $O\left(1\right)$ *expected* (*amortized*) `put()`/`get()`/`remove()` (amortized for `put()`, since we have to take rebuilding the backing array into account).

* The load factor of a hash map is still `size / capacity`, where the `size` counts each element in each linked list.
    * As a result, even if everything hashes to just one or two indices, if the load factor gets large enough to trigger a resize, the resize will still occur.
    * When this happens, everything must be rehashed and recompressed.

## Linear Probing

* *Linear probing* is an open addressing policy.
